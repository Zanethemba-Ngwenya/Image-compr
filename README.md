# Advanced Image Compressor

## Overview
The Advanced Image Compressor is a simple web-based tool designed to help you compress your images efficiently. It allows you to upload a single image, select the desired compression quality, adjust the output size, and choose the format in which you want to save the compressed image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP). After compression, you can preview and download the result.

### Features
- **Single Image Compression**: Upload and compress a single image at a time.
- **Adjustable Compression Quality**: Control the quality of the compressed image via a slider.
- **Size Control**: Set the target size for your compressed image in megabytes (MB).
- **Multiple Format Support**: Choose between JPEG, PNG, or WebP for the output format.
- **Live Progress Indicator**: Monitor the compression process with a progress bar and loading spinner.
- **Preview**: View a preview of the compressed image before downloading.
- **Custom Filename**: Enter a custom name for the output file before saving.

### How to Use

#### 1. **Upload an Image**
Click on the Drag & Drop area or select an image using the file input button to choose the image you want to compress. Only one image can be uploaded at a time.

#### 2. **Set Desired Compression Size**
In the Desired Size (MB) field, enter the target size for your image. The input field is pre-set to a value of 1 MB, but you can adjust it to any value based on your needs.

#### 3. **Adjust Compression Quality**
Use the Compression Quality slider to adjust the quality of your compressed image. The lower the quality, the smaller the file size, but this might reduce the image quality.

#### 4. **Select Output Format**
Choose the desired output format for the image from the dropdown menu. You can select JPEG, PNG, or WebP.

#### 5. **Enter a Filename**
Provide a custom name for the compressed image in the Save As (Filename) input field.

#### 6. **Compress the Image**
Click on the Compress Image button to start the compression process. A progress bar will show the current status, and a loading spinner will appear until the process is complete.

#### 7. **Preview and Download**
Once compression is complete, you will see a preview of the compressed image. You can then click the Download Compressed Image button to save the result.
